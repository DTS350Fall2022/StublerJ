I would argue that the data does absolutely seem to indicate that bleaching 
events are occuring more frequently. For one, outside of the West Atlantic 
visualization, each plot seems visually to clearly be skewed left. In some
cases this is more exaggerated than in others, but this is certainly an indication
of a gradual increase. 

ggplot(data = mydata, aes (x = Year, y = Value, color = Entity)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
  
I chose this layered scatter plot as my secondary visualization because I felt
as though it made comparing each location even easier. I used different
colors as well as incorporated trendlines associated with the five different 
locations in order to increase my ability to compare the nuances over time a 
little more closely.
