#Driving Question(s)
How does the species affect the width and length of the sepal? How much variation lies between 
a single species? Is the width or length more likely to differentiate further from average? 
Is there any overlap between species? Is there more likely to be overlap for width or length across 
species or is there no difference?

#Visualizations helped because...
Each visualization does two things very well. Firstly, they each make it extremely easy to 
differentiate between species. In many cases, color is used to differentiate, and in one case
a scatter plot is facet wrapped by the species so everything is organized neatly. Secondly, 
these visualizations make it very easy to compare information from one species to the next. 
In most cases, they are all operating off the same X and Y axis so any and all overlap is 
obvious. In summary, these visualizations make it easy to analyze each species in isolation, 
but are also useful to compare against the other two and I don't feel like we have to sacrifice
one to get the other at all.
